    <p>Complete Credit Counseling\'s Pre-Filing Credit Counseling Session is available to
        clients who are unable to pay. All clients will be analyzed to determine if they qualify
        for a fee waiver. They will be notified by email if they qualify, with instructions on
        the documentation required for a refund. A client may also request an advance
        determination prior to paying for the session by submitting the appropriate
        documentation. To qualify, the client\'s income must be below 150% of the Federal Poverty
        Guidelines as published yearly by the Department of Health and Human Services. (<a
            href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines">Latest statistics</a>)</p>
    <p>Regardless of fee waiver method (automatic or advance determination) the student is
        required to submit proof of their income for verification. Complete Credit Counseling
        will then determine if the income information submitted qualifies for a fee waiver.
        Qualified no cost students are entitled to receive the internet or mobile version of our
        counseling session, along with all optional services they selected, including faxing,
        mailing, and the audio course for free.</p>
    <p>The following documents are required to be submitted for determination of a fee waiver:
        Submission of Schedules I from the client\'s bankruptcy petition and household size. If
        those are not available, pay stubs (minimum of last 60 days), and the household size are
        required to verify the applicant qualifies.</p>
    <p>The above documentation can be submitted by the client or by any party on the client\'s
        behalf to our Fee Waiver Department. Please redact any sensitive information (such as
        full Social Security Numbers) prior to submitting documentation.</p>
