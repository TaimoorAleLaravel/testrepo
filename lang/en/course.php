    'p2_disclaimer' => "Disclaimer: Complete Credit Counseling, Inc. is not authorized to give you legal advice.",
    'p2_f1' => "No information in our credit counseling materials should be construed as legal advice. All questions concerning whether or not to file bankruptcy should be discussed with a qualified bankruptcy attorney.",
    'p2_f2' => "Under the Bankruptcy Law, you have the option of filing Pro Se. This means you represent yourself in
                    your bankruptcy and fill out the paperwork yourself, without an attorney. However, most bankruptcy
                    professionals do not recommend attempting this. The law is extremely complicated, and difficult to
                    understand. On top of that, every case is different, and yours might not necessarily be an 'easy
                    case'.",
    'p2_f3' => "Speaking generally, an attorney who specializes in bankruptcy tends to know that area of the law much
                    better than an attorney who might only file a few bankruptcies a year.",
    'p2_f4' => "Under the new Bankruptcy Law, you are required to complete a 60-90 minute credit counseling session
                    within 180 days of filing. That is this course that you are taking now.",
    'p2_f5' => "Many of our clients are Pro Se debtors who are representing themselves, but many of our clients were
                    referred to us by their attorney.",
    'p2_f6' => "Your attorney may have gone over your particular situation with you in their office already. Perhaps
                    they explained why credit counseling will not work for you in great detail and already told you
                    about the phone-book sized amount of paperwork you need to assemble and get to their office so that
                    they can file your bankruptcy.",
    'p2_f7' => "Many debtors therefore believe that this mandatory credit counseling exercise is pointless. After
                    all, your bankruptcy attorney may have already told you credit counseling is not going to work for
                    you. For example, if you were sued on a debt, received a judgment against you, and your wages are
                    being garnished, no amount of credit counseling in the world is going to save you from that
                    garnishment. If you cannot afford to pay off the judgment, bankruptcy might be your only option to
                    stop the garnishment.",
    'p2_f8' => "We hope instead you will take a more positive view of this mandatory course, and see it as a chance
                    to explore the options that are available for you. At the very least, it might shed some light on
                    the bankruptcy process and alternatives to bankruptcy that might provide you with some questions to
                    ask your attorney for further guidance about."
